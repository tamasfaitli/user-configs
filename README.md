# Description

Personal Neovim and some other config files. The config is made to best work with [docker devlayer](https://github.com/tamasfaitli/docker-devlayer).

### TODO

- [] improve debugging experience (some keymaps etc..)
- [] figure out how to use json launch files for c++
- [] test the setup with python
- [] document best practices and workflows (e.g. how to setup a c++ project to access all features here)
- [] document (for myself) some overview about the keymappings and how key features were integrated till I remember
- [] integrate unit testing? (not sure yet if want it inside neovim)
